# Contact tracing and periodic contact patterns

Contact tracing is a mechanism for the control of outbreaks. It aims to break transmis-
sion chains by tracing and isolating people exposed to an infectious individual. In this
research work, we investigate how the performance of contact tracing is affected by peri-
odic contact patterns, which are present in events that favor the propagation of diseases
and events that aim to control them.

To answer the research question, we constructed a mathematical model that incorpo-
rates periodicity for each type of contact tracing: backward - which identifies the infectors,
forward - which identifies the infectees, and full - which identifies both. The models in-
corporate the non-recursive and recursive variants of contact tracing. In the non-recursive
variant, the process stops after the contacts of one case are identified, whereas the recursive
variant follows a chain of infections.

We reformulate the question as a set of optimization problems and solve it for the non-
recursive backward contact tracing scenario. Our results indicate that periodic contact
rates positively affect the effectiveness of backward contact tracing. The existence of peri-
odicity increases the probability of extinction of the epidemic and minimizes the effective
reproduction number. The models and optimization problems we propose here can be
employed in future research to explore more complex scenarios and other types of contact
tracing.
